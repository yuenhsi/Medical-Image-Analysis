This repository contains research material pertaining to medical image analysis. 

I wrote various python routines that works with medical imaging datasets related to diffusion MRI. 

I chose to persue a topic regarding fiber clustering and macrostructure, and explored techniques to clustering fibers and recovering fiber tracts. 

The papers I referenced are placed within the "Paper archives" folder. 

Further work done by my professor can be found in this following repository:

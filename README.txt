This contains the code written for the 300-level Computer Science Class, Medical Image Analysis. 

This class is largely research based, and revolves around writing python routines for working with medical imaging datasets related to diffusion MRI. 

The final project is a 7 week long research project. The topic I chose to pursue is named "Fiber Clustering and Other Approaches to Macrostructure", a, where I explore techniques to clustering fibers and recovering fiber tracts. 

The papers I extensively used are put within the "Paper archives" folder.
